## Features to add/improve ðŸ”®


## Get up and running  ðŸš€

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Requirements

In the project directory, you can run:

- Node.js
- NPM
```javascript
/* First, Install the needed packages */
npm install

/* Then start both Node and React */
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Volvo Cars (Global Online Digital)

## Front-end coding test (React)

Our team's designer has come up with a new design to show our latest and greatest recharge cars on the website.

Here is how the design look like for desktop and mobile (files are stored under `docs` folder)

### Desktop

![ProductListDesktop](./docs/ProductList-Desktop.png)

### Mobile

![ProductListDesktop](./docs/ProductList-Mobile.png)

The data required to render the design is under `public/api/cars.json` folder. You need to fetch the data from the client side and render it in the browser. The data looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "xc90-recharge",
    "modelName": "XC90 Recharge",
    "bodyType": "suv",
    "modelType": "plug-in hybrid",
    "imageUrl": "/images/xc90_recharge.jpg"
  }
]
```

The product owner is telling you that you can generate the links to the learn and shop pages of each car by concatating the `id` of the car to the learn (`/learn/`) and shop (`/shop/`) urls.

Two extra SVG icons are also provided by our designer which are stored under `docs` folder.

## Requirements

- The project is bootstraped using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Browser support is modern ever-green browsers.
- Implement this design using React and Typescript.
- Accessibility is important.
- Code Structure and reusablity is important.

## Bonus Points:

- If you use our design system component library, [VCC-UI](https://vcc-ui.vercel.app/)
- If you add a filter bar on the top to filter cars by `bodyType`


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
